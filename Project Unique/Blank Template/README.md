#Project Unique Blank Template
This folder contains a blank project using the Project Unique engine. Copy this folder and paste it somewhere else as the starting point for your games!
Here's a tip to get you started: Make a 'main.lua' file and add "require 'ProjectUnique'" to it. ;)

Also, yes, you may delete this file if you'd like. ;) Just don't delete the included licenses!!!
