#Project Unique Code Samples
This folder is full of sample games/pieces of code that show you to accomplish various tasks in Project Unique. ;)

##Installation instructions
Simply copy the contents of the "Blank Template" folder and paste it into the folder containing the sample you wish to run.

Then you just have to open that entire folder in LÖVE by dragging it onto love.exe! If you don't have LÖVE, you can get it [here](https://love2d.org).
